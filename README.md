# ft_printf
We have to recreate "printf" function in C library from scratch with understanding what is variadic function. <br>
We will generate static library called "libftprintf.a" after that. <br>

Your function has to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%

# Variadic function 
A function that can accept a variable number of arguments. <br>
It takes one fixed argument and then any number of arguments can can be passed.<br>
I have read through this website to understand it. <br>
